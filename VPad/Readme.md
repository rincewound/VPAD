VPAD

Yet another Gamepad-To-Keypad program

What it does:
Takes input from a given USB device and converts it to keystrikes, that are
sent to the active window.

And why, for christ's sake?
Easy: I was too cheap to buy one of the commercial alternatives, so I grabbed
a couple of libarries and made it myself, in order to get to play a couple
of older games on dosbox with a gamepad that has manymany buttons.

Known-Issues:
- Will probably not work with all-too-many devices. 

Licence:
Do as you see fit - given that this is basically a mashup of other libs I don't
claim all that much inventiveness here :)

Uses:
Newtonsoft JSON
SharpHIDLib
"Keyboard"(https://github.com/EasyAsABC123/Keyboard)
